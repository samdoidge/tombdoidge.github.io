I've finally got a website up again. Thanks to the recommendation and guidance of my brother [Sam Doidge](http://samdoidge.com/) I've switched to a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) based site using the [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole/) template. I'm using GitHub Pages for hosting.

I'll soon be customising the appearance of the site from the default look and then getting some content up.
