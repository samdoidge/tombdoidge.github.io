I've finally got a website up again. Thanks to the recommendation and guidance of my brother (Sam Doidge)[http://samdoidge.com/] I've switched to a (Poole)[https://github.com/poole/poole/] based site hosted on GitHub Pages.

I'll soon be customising the appearance of the site from the default look and then getting some content up.
